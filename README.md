Learning Genie

This program plays a questions game with the user and learns from its mistakes, building a database of questions 
and guesses along the way. The program is persistent in that it remembers its database between subsequent runs of the program. 
This way, you can train your program to recognize more and more objects over time. At the moment, the program has a file 
GrinnellBuildingsTree that allows it to know 18 buildings in Grinnell.
